                second studio album, Icarus Falls. In June of the same year, the
                publication further reported Malik had signed a new recording
                contract with Mercury Records, and was poised to release his
                first single under the label "very soon" that summer.Malik is
                expected to transition from his older pop sound to a newer R&B
                sound with his new single "Love Like This", released on 21 July
                2023.
