                studio album Mind of Mine (2016) and its lead single,
                "Pillowtalk", Malik became the first British male artist to
                debut at number one in both the UK and US, with his debut single
                and debut album. His subsequent singles, including "I Don't

                featuring Sia, were also hits. In December 2018, he released his
                second studio album, Icarus Falls. In June of the same year, the
                publication further reported Malik had signed a new recording
                contract with Mercury Records, and was poised to release his
                first single under the label "very soon" that summer.Malik is
                expected to transition from his older pop sound to a newer R&B
                sound with his new single "Love Like This", released on 21 July
                2023.
